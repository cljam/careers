# cljazz careers

We are small and just starting out, _apparently you want to be part of our team that is starting to change the clojure ecosystem for the better_, **so let's do it**.

> **oops**, just a second more, I recommend you read [this document](https://github.com/cljazz?view_as=public#welcome-to-the-cljazz-team-) to understand the cljazz company.

## Don't wait to have a job opening

We like to work with people who **have ambition to grow as a professional**, so just apply and we will talk.

### Steps

- **Testing:** software implementation (full stack, back and front in clojure), see description [here](#testing)
- **Code review:** asynchronously via github (in your repository)
- Talk to the engineering team :tada:

### Follow the steps below to apply

1. Create a git repository with the test implementation - it's okay to be public
2. After implementation send by [email](mailto:hey@cljazz.co) with the subject "I want to work at cljazz - full stack"


## Testing

- Write an application using Clojure and ClojureScript (you choose whether it should be monolithic or separate front and back)
  > **I don't know *Clojure/Script*, now what?**
  >
  > try to learn to make the frontend or backend (one of the two)
  >
  > if you really can't do it, do it in the stack you know
  >
  > **obs:** in the code review we will even ask you how was your study about clojure
- Consume the public api [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co)
- We want to raise the environment using: `docker compose up`
> all external service dependencies should work with this command
- Use [TailwindUI](tailwindui.com) on the frontend
- Have logged area where person can do some "thing" with API data, **e.g.** favoritize a Pokemon - this is just an example
- I want your idea to flow: come up with a cool idea to do on top of the API that we will consume
- Describe your decisions (why you are using it) in `README`, _remember that readme will be the documentation (we want to read it and know how to run the project and how it got to the current point of the software)_
- We are not defining a framework you should use, use the one you are most familiar with
- Needless to say, we expect software with unit tests
